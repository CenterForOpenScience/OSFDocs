**Purpose:** Sharing a preprint helps the user quickly disseminate their work and receive feedback from peers without having to wait for journal peer review. 

Anyone with an OSF account can create a preprint and upload it to OSF Preprints or a community preprint server. A user can upload a new preprint or turn an existing OSF project or component into a preprint. 

When a user uploads a new preprint (and does not use an existing project or component), an OSF project is automatically created to connect to it. The conneced OSF project allows the user to upload supplemental files to their preprint. When a user turns an existing OSF project or component into a preprint, the user can add supplemental files to that project and access the files that they previously added to that project.

A user can access their preprint through their OSF project or component. On the project or component’s Overview page, there will be an alert saying “This [project] [component] represents a preprint. Learn more (this links to preprints help guides] about how to work with preprints.” A user can also access their preprint through the “My Projects” tab and  clicking “All my preprints” from the left sidebar and then clicking the preprint they want to view. 

A user can edit their preprint and upload new versions, but once a preprint is submitted, it cannot be taken down. 

Preprint Detail Page
---------------
 **Purpose:** The "Preprint Detail" page is the main page where the user reads and downloads a given preprint.

At the top of the "Preprint Detail" page, the preprint's title appears in large typeface. The date when the preprint was shared and the date when the preprint was last edited are listed below the preprint's title.

On the left half of the page, the preprint appears in an MFR, below which a "Download preprint" button, and the supplemental files (if the user has uploaded any) are shown. The preprint file will also be listed below the MFR but only in the event that there are supplemental files.

On the right half of the page, the preprint's abstract, license, disciplines, DOI (if any), tags, and citation styles (MLA, APA, and Chicago) are listed. If an abstract is long, there will be a **See more** button below the abstract that the user can click to expand the remaining text. When the abstract is expanded, the button changes to **See less**. When the user clicks the **See less** button, the abstract shrinks back to its shorter length, and the **See more** button returns.

In the top right of the Preprint Detail page, there is a gray box that includes a series of actions for downloading and sharing a preprint::

   [Download preprint], the number of downloads [Downloads: x], and social media sharing options

At the bottom right of the page, there is a gray box that reads::
  
  The project for this paper is available on the OSF
  [Visit project] (links to the OSF project connected to a preprint)

The user who uploaded the preprint can see a green "Edit preprint" button in the top right of the Preprint Detail page. Visitors to a Preprint Detail page cannot see this button.

OSF Preprints Landing Page
---------------
**Purpose:** To search for preprints, upload a preprint, and access the preprint community servers.

To navigate to the OSF Preprints landing page, the user can click the "Browse" tab from the gray navigation bar and then click "Preprints" from the drop-down menu.

On the OSF Preprints landing page, there is a search field to search for preprints and a green [Add a preprint] button below the search field.

In the top right, there's a toolbar with the following actions:

*An "Add a preprint" tab that takes the user to the "Add a preprint" page.

*A "Search" tab that takes the user to the Preprint Archive Search page.

The following tabs appear in the navigation bar when the user is logged out:

*"Browse". Clicking this tab unfolds a drop-down menu with :ref:`these options <browse>`. 
*"Support". CLicking this tab takes the user to `<https://osf.io/support/>`_.
*"Sign Up".Clicking this tab takes the user to the :ref:`Create a free account page <sign-up>` where the user needs to fill out a form to create an OSF account.
*"Sign In". Clicking this tab takes the user to the :ref:`OSF sign-in page <login>`. After logging in, the user is taken to the OSF Preprints landing page.

The community preprint servers are listed with their logos below the search field. Clicking on a community preprint server takes the user to the community preprint server's landing page.

Landing Pages for Community Preprint Servers
---------------
**Purpose:** To search for preprints within and upload preprints to a given preprint server.

When a user navigates to a community preprint server, the landing page is the same as OSF Preprints, except for different color schemes and different actions in the :ref:`navigation bar <navigation-bar>`

The following tabs appear in the navigation bar when the user is logged out:

*"Add a preprint": Clicking this tab takes the user to the :ref:`OSF sign-in page <login>`.
*"Search". Clicking this tab takes the user to the Preprint Archive Search page within the given preprint server.
*"Sign Up". Clicking this tab takes the user to the :ref:`Create a free account page <sign-up>` where the user needs to fill out a form to create an OSF account in order to be able to upload a preprint to the community preprint server. 
*"Sign In". Clicking this tab takes the user to the :ref:`OSF sign-in page <login>`. After logging in, the user is taken to their OSF dashboard.

The following tabs appear in the navigation bar when the user is logged in:

*"My OSF Projects". Takes the user to the "My Projects" page, where "All my projects" is selected automatically from the side menu.
*"Add a preprint". Takes the user to the "Add a preprint page."

*"Search": Clicking this tab takes the user to the Preprint Archive Search page within the given preprint server.
*"[Username]". Clicking this tab creates a drop-down menu with the following items:
    
    *"My Profile". Clicking this item takes the user to their profile page.
    *"Support". Clicking this item takes the user to the `support page <https://osf.io/support/>`_
    *"Settings". Clicking this item takes the user to their user settings page. 
    *"Log out". Clicking this items logs the user out of their OSF account and takes them to the OSF homepage, where a confirmation message will appear at the top of the page informing them that they have logged out succesfully. URL is osf.io/goodbye.

.. _adding-preprint: 

Adding a Preprint
---------------
  **The following describes the upload process when sharing a preprint with OSF Preprints.The upload process is the same when a user shares a preprint with a community preprint server.**
  
Clicking the green "Add a preprint" button takes the user to the Add Preprint page where the user must follow five steps in order to share a preprint:

* Upload: The user adds their preprint file and enters a preprint title.
* Discipline: The user adds disciplines to their preprint.
* Basics: The user adds a license and includes an abstract of at least 20 characters.
* Authors: The user adds coauthors, but can also choose to be the only author.
* Submit: The user uploads their preprint to the preprint server.

After a user clicks "Save and continue" in each widget, a confirmation message appears in to top right corner of the widget::
  
    Changes Saved!

A user must complete the required steps within each widget before they can upload their preprint. 
    
The Upload Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose**: Allows the user to upload their preprint file.

The Upload widget is expanded automatically when the user arrives on the Add Preprint page.

If the user does not complete the upload widget and clicks inside another widget, has not completed the steps within a widget and clicks inside another widget, an alert will appear in the top right corner of the Add preprint page::

    Please complete upload section before continuing
    
The alert has an animated reverse progress bar that functions as a timer. When the animation completes, the alert disappears, and the Upload widget remains open.

The widget contains two options for adding a preprint file::

    [Upload new preprint][Connect preprint to existing OSF project]

.. _new-preprint:
**Upload new preprint**

When the user clicks "Upload new preprint," a box in which the user uploads their preprint file appears with instructions that read::
      
    Drop preprint file here to upload

There are two buttons to the bottom right of the file box::
    [Back][Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have uploaded their file and entered a title for their preprint. If the user tries to click "Save and continue," a hazard symbol appears on the tail of the cursor, and the user is unable to click the button to progress to the next widget.

The user can add their preprint file in two different ways:

1. The user can drag and drop their file into the file box
2. The user can click inside (double click for Windows) the file box to open a dialog box from which they can select and upload their file. The dialog box will close when the user clicks the "Choose" button. 

After the user adds their preprint file, the file appears in the middle of the file box, where the preprint's filename and the file size are listed. The user has the option to upload a new preprint file to replace the one they previously added. Below the filename and file size, the instructions in the box now read::
    
    Click or drag another preprint file to replace

After uploading the preprint file, the preprint title field appears below the file box, with instructions that read::
    
    Enter preprint title
    
The user must enter a title for their preprint into the field before they can continue to the next widget.

If a user clicks inside the title field without entering a title, and then clicks elsewhere within the widget, a growlbox appears below the title field that reads::
  
      Title can't be blank

After entering a title, the user can click "Save and continue" or press the **return** key (Mac) or the **enter** key (Windows) on their computer to continue on to the "Discipline" widget.

An alert confirming the upload will appear in the top right of the page::
  
    Preprint file uploaded!

This alert has an animated reverse progress bar that functions as a timer. When the animation completes, the alert disappears.

**Connect preprint to existing OSF project**

Clicking the Connect Preprint to existing OSF project brings up the Choose Project box::

    Click to select
    [drop-down selections][a list of the user's OSF projects and components]
    **The list of projects appearing in the selector are projects and components for which you have admin access. Registrations are not included here.
    
After the user selects a project or component from the drop-down list, the Choose Project section closes, and the Choose File section appears below it. The Choose Project section is still viewable and accessible to the user. The box reads::

    Choose Project
    [project or component name]
    *Click to Edit*

The user can click anywhere inside the Choose Project section to open it. When reopening the box, the user can choose a different project or component.

In the Choose File section two options appear for uploading a preprint file to the OSF project or component::
  
    [Upload preprint][Select existing file as preprint]

If the user clicks "Upload preprint," the file box appears with instructions that read::
  
    Drop preprint file here to upload
    
After the user uploads their preprint file, the file box briefly shows the filename and file size before the Choose File section closes, and the Organize section appears below it.

If the user clicks "Select existing file as preprint," the Choose File section will show the files uploaded to the project or component's OSF storage (files uploaded to storage add-ons are not available to use as preprints).

After the user chooses the file they want to use for their preprint, the Choose File section will close and the Organize box will appear below it.

The Choose File section is still viewable and accessible to the user. The box reads::

    Choose File (this is a link that the use can click to expand the box)
    [filename]
    *Click to Edit*

The user can click anywhere inside the Choose File section to open it. When reopening the section, the user can choose a different file from OSF storage to use for their preprint.
    
After the user has finished choosing and uploading their preprint file, the Organize section will appear.

If the user previously chose to upload their preprint to an OSF project, the Organize secion will display two options for connecting a preprint to a project::
  
    You can organize your preprint by storing the file in this project or in its own new component. If you select 'Make a new component', the prperint file will be stored in a new component inside this project. If you  select 'Use the current project', the preprint file will be stored in this project. If you are unsure, select 'Make a new component'.
    [Make a new component][Use the current project]
    
If the user clicks "Make a new component," the Finalize Upload section will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize sections::

    Enter preprint title (this is a field)
    You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
    [Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.
    
If the user clicks "Use the current project," a growlbox will appear below the two options with an exclamation point icon to the left of the message::
  
    Your project details will be saved as you continue to work on this form.
    Changes you make on this page are saved immediately. Create a new component under this project to avoid overwriting its details.
    [Create a new component][Continue with this project]
    
If the user clicks "Create a new component," the Finalize Upload section will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize sectioms where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the uesr clicks "Continue with this project," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes, where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the user previously chose to upload their preprint to a component, the Organize box will display two options for connecting a preprint to a component::
  
    You can organize your preprint by storing the file in this component or in its own new component. If you select ‘Make a new component’, the preprint file will be stored in a new component inside this component. If you select ‘Use the current component’, the preprint file will be stored in this component. If you are unsure, select ‘Make a new component’.
    [Make a new component][Use the current component]
        
If the user clicks "Make a new component," the Finalize Upload section will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize sections::

    Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
    You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
    [Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the user clicks "Use the current component," a growlbox will appear below the two options with an exclamation point icon to the left of the message::

  Your component details will be saved as you continue to work on this form.
  Changes you make on this page are saved immediately. Create a new component under this component to avoid overwriting its details.
  [Create a new component][Continue with this component]

If the user clicks "Create a new component," the Finalize Upload section will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize sectionz, where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the user clicks "Continue with this component," the Finalize Upload section will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize sections, where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

When the user enters a preprint title and clicks "Save and continue," the Upload widget closes, and the Discipline widget expands.

The user can return to the Upload widget to make changes at any point throughout the preprint upload process. 

When closed, the Upload widget appears as follows::
  
    *Preprint location:* [project or component name]
    *Preprint file:* [file name] *(Version: [number]*
    *Preprint title:* [preprint title]
    *Click to Edit*

When returning to the Upload widget, the user can click inside the the widget to open it. The user can only make changes to the preprint file (can upload a new file as long as it has the same name as the previous file) and edit the preprint title. The user cannot change their OSF project or component. At the bottom of the Upload widget, there is a message and two buttons that read::
  
    Edits to this preprint will update both the preprint and the OSF project.
    [Discard changes][Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Discard changes" unless they have made changes to the preprint file or title. Once the user has made changes, they can click this button or click within whichever widget they are currently working on to discard the changes they made to the Upload widget.
    
The Discipline Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Allows the user to add disciplines and subdisciplines (optional) to their preprint to make it more discoverable.

The taxonomy for the disciplines comes from BePress.

At the top of the Discipline widget, there is a message that reads::
  
    Select a discipline and subdiscipline, if relevant. Add more by clicking on a new discipline or subdiscipline.

There are three columns that sort the hierarchies of the disciplines and subdisciplines (aka the *discipline chooser*).

There are two buttons in the bottom right of the widget::
  
    [Discard changes][Save and continue]

In the left column, all of the disciplines available in OSF Preprints are listed::

    Architecture
    Arts and Humanities
    Business
    Education
    Engineering
    Law
    Life Sciences
    Medecine and Health Sciences
    Physical Sciences and Mathematics
    Social and Behavioral Sciences
    
When selecting a discipline, the user must click on a top-level discipline from the left column, and it will be added to their preprint. Their disciplines will appear above the discipline chooser.

When selecting a subdiscipline, the user must click on a top-level discipline to show its subsdisciplines in the middle column. The user can click on a subdiscipline from the middle column to show its subdisciplines in the right column.

To remove disciplines from their preprint, the user can click the white "x" to the right of their added disciplines.

The user can click inside any other widget prior to adding disciplines; however, the user must add at least one discipline to their preprint before they can upload it.

Until the user adds a discipline, they will not be able to click "Discard changes" or "Save and continue."

When the user clicks "Save and continue," the Discipline widget will close, and the Basics widget will open.

The user can return to the Discipline widget to make changes at any point throughout the preprint upload process. 

The Basics Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Allows the user to add a license, DOI (if they have one), tags, and an abstract to their preprint.

In the bottom right of the Basics widget, there are two buttons::
  
    [Discard changes][Save and continue]

These buttons remain unclickable until the user has filled out all of the required sections and fields. The required sections and fields for this widget are:

* Choose a license
* Abstract

If the user chooses the No license option from the Choose a license drop-down menu, the two fields that appear below the menu are also required:
* Year
* Copyright Holders

**The License section**

In the license section, the user has the following options::
    
    **Choose a license:** (required)
    [Drop-down selections:] CCO 1.0 Universal (this one is selected automatically)
                            CC-By Attribution 4.0 International
                            No license
    License FAQ (this links to the license FAQ page)
    Show full text (clicking this shows an explanation of the license selected)
    Hide full text (this appears in place of Show full text when the user clicks to view the text)
    
.. _todo: license FAQ currently links to the `Licensing help guide <http://help.osf.io/m/60347/l/611430-licensing>`. Update this section when the text changes.

When the user selects "No license" from the drop-down menu, the "Year" and "Copyright Holders" fields appear below the menu.

These two fields are required. In the "Year" field, the current year is listed automatically. If the user deletes the current year - e.g. "2017"- from the field, the year will reappear automatically in the field. To enter a different year, the user can delete the last 1-3 numbers and type in the correct year from there. If the user deletes the first number- e.g. "2"- the year will reappear automatically in the field.

There is an option to "Apply this preprint license to my OSF project." The user can select "Yes" or "No" to either extend or not extend the preprint license to their OSF project. "Yes" is selected automatically. Note that if the user selects "No license" option from the drop-down menu, they can choose to extend this license to their OSF project, as well.

**The DOI section**
In the DOI section (if the user's preprint has already been published in a journal), the user can enter their DOI of the associated journal into the DOI field. There is a message above the DOI field that reads::
  
    **If published, DOI of associated journal article (optional)**
    
If the user enters an invalid DOI, a growlbox appears below the DOI field that reads::
  
    Please use a valid DOI
    
The growlbox disappears when the user deletes the invalid DOI.

When the user clicks inside the DOI field, begins typing, or enters an invalid DOI, the field is outlined in blue. 

When the user enters a valid DOI into the DOI field, the field is outlined in green.

**The Keywords section**
    
In the Keywords section, the user can add tags to their preprint in the text box that has the instructions::
  
    Add a tag

**The Abstract section**

In the Abstract section, the textbox has instructions that read::
  
    Add a brief summary of your preprint

If the user starts typing into the Abstract textbox and deletes what they have written, a growlbox will appear below the textbox that reads::
  
    Abstract can't be blank

When the user starts typing their abstract and the content is--so far--less than 20 characters long, a growlbox will appear below the textbox that reads::
  
    Abstract is too short (minimum is 20 characters)

The growlbox disappears once the user has typed 20 characters. When the abstract is less than 20 characters, the textbox is outlined in blue, but when the abstract reaches 20 characters and more, the textbox is outlined in green.

When the user has filled out all of the required sectons and fields, they can either click [Discard changes][Save and continue]

Clicking "Discard changes" will cause a growlbox to appear below the Abstract textbox that reads::
  
    Abstract can't be blank

**Finishing the Basics Widget**
 
In the event that the user chooses "No license" from the drop-down menu and fills out the "Year" and "Copyright Holders" fields as their last steps before they finish the Basics widget, the user can press the **return** key (Mac) or the **Enter** key (Windows) on their computer to close the Basics widget and open the Authors widget.

The user can also click [Save and continue] to close the Basics widget and open the Authors widget.

This is how the widget appears when closed::
  
    Basics (this is a link that the user can use to click to open the widget; the user can click anywhere inside the widget to open it)
    License: [license type]
    DOI: [DOI] (or) None (if no DOI is provided)
    Abstract:
    [abstact content]
    Click to Edit
    
The user can click inside the Basics widget to open it and make changes at any point throughout the preprint upload process. When the user reopens the Basics widget, they cannot click "Discard changes" unless they have made changes to the information they previously provided in the widget. Once the user has made changes to the information, the user can click "Discard changes."

The Authors widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** To add authors and sort the authorship order.

A user can search for and add authors to their preprint.

At the top of the Authors widget, there are instructions that read::
  
    Add preprint authors and order them appropriately. All changes to authors are saved immediately. Search looks for authors that have OSF accounts already. Unregistered users can be added and invited to join the preprint.

**Search for an author:** To add an author, the user must type the author's name into the search field. The search field has a message within it that reads::
    
    Search by name [magnifying glass symbol]

When the user types the author's name into the search field, the user can either press enter on their keyboard or click the magnifying glass symbol.

Once the user enters their search query, a gray box appears below the search field that reads::
  
    Can't find the user you're looking for?
    [Add author by email address]

If the author does not have an OSF account, a Results section will appear below the gray box that reads::
  
    No results found.

If the user clicks the "Add author by email address" button, the gray box will disappear, and the Add author by email section will appear below the search field with the following form::
  
    Add author by email
    Full Name
    [full name field] Full name
    Email
    [email field] Email
    We will notify the user that they have been added to your preprint.
                                                          [Cancel][Add]
                                                
If the user clicks inside the Full Name and Email fields without entering information and then clicks outside of these fields, the following growlbocs appear below each respective field::
  
    Full Name can't be left blank (the full name field)
    This field can't be blank (the email field)

If the user enters an author's name that is less than three characters, a growlbox appears below the Full Name field that reads::
  
    Full Name is too short (minimum is 3 characters)

If the user enters an invalid email address into the Email field, a growlbox appears below the Email field that reads::
  
    This field must be a valid email address
  
Until the user enters the information correctly into these fields, the fields will be outlined in blue, and the green "Add" button will be unclickable. The user can, however, click the "Cancel" button.

When the user enters in the information correctly, the fields will be outlined in green, and the user can click the green "Add" button.

When the user clicks the green "Add" button, the author will be added to the Authors section on the right side of the widget below the user's name.
  
If the author who the user searches for has an OSF account, a Results section will appear below the gray box, and the author's name will be listed in the Results section with a green "Add" button to the right of their name.

When the user clicks the green "Add" button, the author will be added to the Authors section on the right side of the widget below the user's name.

**Reorder Authors:**
If the user adds more than one author, each author will be added according to the order in which the user adds them.

At the top of the Authors section, there are instructions that read::
  
    Drag and drop authors to change authorship order.

In each author row, there are four columns: Name, Permissions, Citation, and a red "Remove" button.

To the left of each author row, there is a hamburger that the user can click to drag and drop the authors into a different order.

Under the Permissions column, each author (except for the user uploading the preprint, who is listed as the administrator) has a Permissions menu. In the Permissions menu, the Read + Write permissions are selected automatically. The user can click inside the menu to open a pop-over from which the user can assign different permissions to their authors. The permissions options are: Read, Read + Write, and Administrator. There is a question mark to the right of the Permissions header. When the user hovers over the question mark, a tooltip appears that explains the permissions levels::
  
    Read
        *View a preprint
    Read + Write
        *Read privileges
        *Add and configure preprint
        *Add and edit content
    Administrator
        *Read and write privileges
        *Manage authors
        *Public-private settings

Under the Citation column, there is a checkbox in each author's row. The checkbox is selected automatically. When the checkbox is selected, the corresponding author will appear in citations. When the checkbox is unchecked, the author will not be included in citations but can read and modify the preprint, according to their permissions. There is a question mark below the Citation header. When the user hovers over the question mark, a tooltip appears that explains what checking and unchecking the Citation box means::
  
    Only checked authors will be included in preprint citations. Authors not in the citation can read and modify the preprint as normal.

Clicking the red "Remove" button will delete the author from the preprint. The author will not aware that they were added or deleted.

When the user is finished filling out the Authors widget, they can click the blue "Next" button in the bottom right of the widget.

After the user clicks the "Next" button, the widget will close and the Submit widget will open. 

The user can click inside the Authors widget to make changes to the information after the user has continued on to the next widget. When the user reopens the Authors widget, they can click the "Next" button at any time, with or without making changes to the information within the widget.

The Submit Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** To post their preprint to a preprint server and make it publicly available.

At the top of the Submit widget, there are instructions that read::
  
    When you share this preprint, it will become publicly accessible via OSF Preprints. You will be unable to delete the preprint file, but you can update or modify it. This also creates an OSF project in case you would like to attach other content to your preprint such as supplementary materials, appendices, data, or protocols. If posting this preprint is your first exposure to the OSF, you will receive an email introducing OSF to you. By clicking Share, you confirm that all Contributors agree with sharing this preprint, and that you have the right to share it.

If the user has not completed the required information in a given widget, a growlbox will appear below the above instructions that read::
  
    The following section(s) must be completed before sharing this preprint.
    [widget title(s)]
    
The user could skip the Author widget (either by not clicking inside the widget at all or by not clicking the **Next** button) and submit their preprint without any message or growlbox appearing.

When the user is ready to submit their preprint, they can click the blue "Share" button. Clicking "Share" causes a modal to appear::

    Share Preprint
    Once this preprint is made public, you should assume that it will always be public. Even if you delete it, search engines or others may access the files before you do so.
    [Cancel][Share]
    
Clicking "Cancel" will return the user to the "Add Preprint" page with all of their preprint upload information still intact.

Clicking "Share" will take the user directly to the Preprint Detail page.

Edit a Preprint
---------------
**Purpose:** To upload a new version of a preprint and/or edit the preprint's metadata.

Clicking the green "Edit preprint" button in the top right of the Preprint Detail page takes the user to the Edit Preprint page. 

The user can edit the widgets in any order, but the user cannot leave any of the required information blank, just as they could not during the :ref:`preprint upload process <adding-preprint>`. If the user leaves required information blank and clicks the "Complete" button inside the Update widget to apply their changes, the original metadata will still appear on the Preprint Detail page.

The preprint editing process is the same as the preprint uploading process. The only differences are that the Upload widget has a different workflow, and the submit widget and "Share" button are now called the Upload widget and the "Complete" button, respectively.

Editing the Upload Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The user cannot edit the Preprint Location section (i.e. the OSF project or component to which their preprint is connected). The Preprint Location section is grayed out and has a lock symbol next to the project/component name.

To upload a new version of their preprint, the user must click to open the Preprint File section. There is a message at the top of this section::
  
    Update preprint file version. File must have the same name as the original.

The user can then drag and drop the new version of their preprint file onto the page in the same way as when they uploaded the :ref:`first version of their preprint <new-preprint>`. If the user uploads a file with a different filename from the original, an alert will appear in the top right of the page::
  
    This is not a version of the current preprint file.

The alert has an animated reverse progress bar that functions as a timer. When the animation completes, the alert disappears, and the Preprint File section closes. 

If the user uploads a new version of their preprint file with the same filename as the original, the Preprint File section will close after the user drags and drops the file onto the page. The filename will appear in the section with a version number next to it::
    
    [filename](Version:x)

The Preprint's OSF Project
---------------
**Purpose**: To add supplemental files to a preprint.

On the bottom right of the Preprint Detail page, there is a gray box and a button::
  
    The project for this paper is available on the OSF.
    [Visit project]
    
Clicking the "Visit project" button takes the user to the Project Overview page. A preprint's Project Overview has the same layout as the :ref:`Project Overview page <overview>`, except with the following preprint alert and buttons::
  
    This project represents a preprint. Learn more about how to work with preprint files.[Edit preprint][View preprint]

Clicking the "Edit preprint" button takes the user to the Edit Preprint page.

Clicking the "View preprint" button takes the user to the Preprint Detail page.

Adding Supplemental Files
---------------
**Purpose:** Allows the user to add supplemental files, code, and other matierals to their preprint.

Adding supplemental files to a preprint works in the same way as adding files to a regular OSF project using the :ref:`OSF storage <OSF-storage>`. The user can only add supplemental files at the top level. Files uploaded to storage add-ons will not appear as *supplemental files* on the Preprint Detail page.

On the Preprint Detail page, supplemental files appear below the MFR. The user can click on a file and the file will appear in the MFR. If there are more than six files (including the primary file) below the MFR, the files will appear in a carousel, and the user can click the right arrow to navigate through the rest of the files. When the user clicks the right arrow to navigate through the files, a left arrow will appear for the user to navigate back through the first set(s) of files.

The metadata and citation styles for the preprint stay the same along the right side of the page, even if the user clicks to read a supplemental file.

If a user clicks on a supplemental file (any file that is not labelled "Primary"), the "Download preprint" button located below the MFR changes to "Download file." The "Download preprint" button located in the top right of the page stays the same and downloads the primary preprint file even if a supplemental file is displayed in the MFR.

Search Preprints
---------------
**Purpose**: To search for and browse preprints in OSF Preprints and other preprint servers.

OSF Preprints is an aggregator of several preprint servers and is powered by SHARE. On the OSF Preprints and community preprint servers' landing pages, the user can enter a search query to search for preprints. The search results will appear on the Preprint Archive Search page. 

The user can search by preprint title by entering the title into the search field. To search by an author(s) or a tag(s), the user should use the boolean operaters AND (including x and x) and OR (including x or x). The accepted formats for searching one or more authors is as follows:
  
  * author:(albert einstein)
  * author: "albert einstein"
  * author: 'albert einstein'
  
  * authors:(nosek AND spies)
  * authors: "nosek AND spies"
  * authors:'nosek AND spies'
  
The accepted formats for searching one or more tags is as follows:

  * tags:"multimedia"
  * tags:(multimedia)
  * tags: 'multimedia'
  
  * tags:"computer AND science"
  * tags:(computer AND science)
  * tags:'computer AND science'

  * tags:"psychology OR neuroscience"
  * tags:(psychology OR neuroscience)
  * tags:'psychology OR neuroscience'

To browse by subject area, there is a list of disciplines on the OSF Preprints and community preprint servers' landing pages. Clicking a subject area will yield preprints within that subject on the Preprint Archive Search page.

On the Preprint Archive Search page, there is a Provider side bar that shows all of the preprint servers aggregated in that particular preprint server. The user can select a preprint server to search for preprints uploaded to that server.

Below the Provider sidebar, there is a Subject sidebar that is sorted hierarchically. Clicking the arrow next to a subject will unfold the subdisciplines within that subject area. Selecting a subject area will show preprints within that subject area.

Preprint search results display the preprint title first, followed by the author(s), discipline(s), abstract, and preprint provider. To access the rest of the metadata, there is a down arrow that the user can click to unfold the search result on the Preprint Archive Search page. Clicking the down arrow shows external links, such as a link to a preprint's journal publication, etc., an OAI (if any), tags (if any), and the date and time on which the preprint was added.
