**Purpose:** Commenting allows contributors on private projects and OSF users on public projects - when allowed by the project administrator(s) - to discuss the project's contents. 

When a user has commenting permissions, a blue chat icon will appear along the project banner in the top right. Clicking the icon will open a Comments panel. The project title appears at top of the panel followed by a text box to add a comment. Comments are ordered top to bottom from most recent to least recent. 

Comments appear with the commentor's name as well as how long ago the comment was made. Three icons allow interaction with a commentor's own comment after posting. The pencil icon allows the user the edit their comment. The arrow icon allows the user to reply to the comment. The trash can icon allows the user to delete the comment. Comments by other users appear with the arrow icon for replying and the triangular warning icon for reporting spam or abuse. 

When a user reports a comment, they are prompted to mark it as "Spam or advertising," "Hate speech," or "Violence or harmful behavior." An optional textbox allows them to describe the abuse further, followed by [Cancel] and [Report] buttons. Reporting a comment hides it from the reporter and instead shows text saying "Comment reported." and "Not abuse." Other users can still see the comment. Selecting "Not abuse" will regenerate the comment for the reporter. Replies to a comment are visible regardless of the parent comment's visibility. 

Deleting a comment replaces the comment with text saying "Comment deleted." and "Restore." Selecting "Restore" will reinstate the orginal comment. Only the original commentor may delete their own comment and reinstate it. 

The user can address a comment to a contributor by typing "@" followed by the contributor's name. Typing "@" prompts a drop-down menu to appear where the user can select any of the names of the project's contributors. The mentioned contributor will receive an email notifying them that they have been addressed in a comment. Comments with replies appear with a plus icon on the right side of the comment. Clicking the plus icon expands the comment thread and causes the plus icon to change to a minus icon. Likewise, clicking the minus icon collapses the comment thread and causes the minus icon to change back to the plus icon.
