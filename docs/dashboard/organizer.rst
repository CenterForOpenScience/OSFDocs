**Purpose:** My Projects houses most of the functionality on the user’s dashboard. It lists projects and allows
the user to sort and act on those projects. The Project Organizer is the center of the My Projects page. 

My Projects is found by clicking "My Projects" in the blue navigation bar or by going to osf.io/myprojects when logged in.  

Contents of the Project Organizer can be searched through by typing in the "Filter displayed projects” field in the top right of the page. 

My Projects consists of 3 panes. The left pane is a Filter pane and provides options for filtering which projects are displayed. The center pane is the Project Organizer, displaying project titles, contributors, and date last modified. The right pane is the Information Panel, displaying information about or recent activity on a selected project or component. 

Filter Pane
-------------
**Purpose:** The filter pane provides users with several options for filtering the projects displayed in the Project Organizer. The first section is Collections, followed by Contributors, then Tags. Each section displays only four entries. Forward and backward arrows allow users to access more options for filtering

Collections
----------
**Purpose:** Collections allow users to create a customized organization system on their Project Organizer.

Collections are user defined project groups. Collections can house a user’s projects and :ref:`components <components>` or
:ref:`public <privacy>` projects and components that they are not contributors on. A project can belong to multiple collections.

To create a collection, the user clicks on “+” to the right of the word Collections. To add a project to a collection,
the user selects, from elsewhere on the project organizer, the project they wish to add and drags and drops it into the
collection.

To delete a collection, the user clicks the 3 vertical dots to the right of the Collection's name and selects "Delete."

To rename a collection, the user clicks the 3 vertical dots to the right of the Collection's name and selects "Rename."

Mousing over the info icon displays an information box::

    Collections are groups of projects. You can create custom collections. Drag and drop your projects or bookmarked projects to add them. 

By default, the collections "All my projects," "All my registrations," and "Bookmarks" are shown. These collections cannot be removed.

Projects can be removed from collections or the "Dashboard" folder by selecting the project and clicking “Remove From
Collection” in the right pane. Removing a project does not delete the project or its contents, but removes it from the containing element.

Public projects can also be added to the Project Organizer by visiting them and clicking on the “Add to Bookmarks”
button on the project overview. This button is depicted by a folder with a plus sign to its right. On hover, “Add to
Bookmarks” appears. Clicking adds the project and all public components within it to the "Bookmarks" Collection on the
Project Organizer. When clicked, the plus sign turns into a minus sign and on hover a tooltip reads “Remove from Bookmarks."

Contributors
----------
**Purpose:** Clicking a contributor's name allows the user to filter for only those projects that both he/she and the selected name are contributors on. 

Tags
----------
**Purpose:** Clicking on a tag allows the user to filter for only those projects that contain the selected tag. 

..::Todo: What happens when user clicks multiple contributor names or tags. What if the tag is on a file and not a project? 


Project Organizer - Projects and Components in the Project Organizer
-----------

**Purpose:** Projects and components, as the primary units of content on the OSF, are the focus of the
Project Organizer. The center pane displays projects and components that match the filters the user has applied. If no filters have been applied, this center pane displays all of the users' projects. Nested components can be seen by clicking the "+" sign to the left of the project name. Highlighting (clicking next to a project or component's name) displays information about the project or component in the right pane. Clicking on a project or component takes the user to the Project or Component Overview page. 


Sorting Project Organizer Content
------------
**Purpose:** Sorting contents by column headers in the Project Organizer allows users to more quickly find an item that they are looking for.

The Project Organizer can sort its contents by Name, in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order, or by Date Last Modified. By default, content is sorted by Date Last Modified. Within a collection or project, contents are also sorted according to date last modified by default. 


Information Panel
----------

**Purpose:** The right pane of the Project Organizer displays information about the selected proejct or component in two tabs: Information and Recent Activity.

If the project is part of a Collection, a button appears at the top of the panel, "Remove from collection."

Information tells the user::
    
    Visibility: (Public or Private)
    Category: (Project or component category)
    Last modified: (date last modified)
    Tags applied to the project

Activity show the user the most recent 6 logged actions on the project as well as which contributor took the action. A link at the end of the list provides the user the option to Show more entries.
