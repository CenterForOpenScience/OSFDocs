The landing page is branded::

A list of institutions appears down the page. Each institution is represented by the institutional name and logo. The user can filter the list by typing in the name or sorting alphabetically. If filtering by a name that does not exist, no results will appear in the list.

Selecting an institution from the list takes the user to the institutional landing page for that institution.
