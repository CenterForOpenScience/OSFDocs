Searching OSF Registries
------------------------

OSF Registries is powered by SHARE. On the OSF Registries landing page, the user can search for registrations by typing a query into the search box or by clicking a registration in the "Browse Registrations" section.

When the user selects a registration below the "Browse Registrations" section, they are taken to the registration form for that registration. 

When the user types a query into the search box on the landing page, search results relevant to that query will appear.

Registration cards on the "Discover" page list the registration title, authors, registry, registration form, and include the URLs of the registration "Overview" page and SHARE entry. In the top right of each card is a sharing icon. Clicking this icon displays a drop-down menu with options to share the registration on Twitter, Linkedin, or by email.

To search by registration titles, the user can simply enter the title into the search box and press **enter** on their keyboard or click the **search** button. To search by author(s) or keyword(s), the user should use the boolean operators *AND* and *OR*. To refine a search with boolean operators, the user should type any of the following syntaxes:

**SEARCH BY AUTHOR**
* author:(albert einstein)

* author: “albert einstein”

* author: ‘albert einstein’

* authors:(nosek AND spies)

* authors: “nosek AND spies”

* authors:’nosek AND spies’

**SEARCH BY KEYWORD**

* tags:”multimedia”

* tags:(multimedia)

* tags: ‘multimedia’

* tags:”computer AND science”

* tags:(computer AND science)

* tags:’computer AND science’

* tags:”psychology OR neuroscience”

* tags:(psychology OR neuroscience)

* tags:’psychology OR neuroscience’

On the OSF Registries search page, there are two left sidebars with filters by which the user can refine their search:

* a "Provider" sidebar that shows all of the registration providers that OSF Registries aggregates
* an "OSF Registration Type" sidebar that shows all of the registration types that the OSF offers. 

The user can select a registration provider to search for registrations posted to a specific provider.

The "OSF Registration Type" sidebar will only be available to the user if they select **OSF Registries** and only **OSF Registries** from the "Provider" sidebar. Otherwise, the "OSF Registration Type" sidebar will be grayed out and will have a red alert above it that reads::
  
    Only available with OSF Registries

If the user selects **OSF Registries** and any additional providers, the "OSF Registration Type" sidebar will be unavailable to use. 

When the user selects **OSF Registries**, the red alert disappears and the sidebar becomes available. The user can check the boxes next to the registration types by which they want to filter search results. Checking the boxes will show the public registrations that are of those registration types.

Registration search results display the registration title first, followed by the author(s), description, provider, date the project was registered, links, and the date on which the registration was added.
