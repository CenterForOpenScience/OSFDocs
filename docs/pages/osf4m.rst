Clicking the up arrow in the "Name" column sorts conference titles in reverse alphabetical order, and clicking the down arrow sorts them alphabetically, with numbers appearring before "A". Clicking the up arrow in the "Submissions" column sorts conferences from the least number of submissions (5 being the lowest number) to the greatest number, and clicking the down arrow sorts them from greatest to least. Clicking the up arrow in the "Location" column sorts confererences by location in alpabetical order, with no locations appearing before "A," and clicking the down arrow sorts in reverse alphabetical order. Clicking the up arrow in the "Date" column sorts conferences by the earliest date that the meeting was created, with no dates appearing before the earliest date, and clicking the down arrow sorts them by the most recently created date.

Clicking on a conference takes the user to the landing page for the conference.


OSF for Meetings conference pages
---------------------------------

**Purpose:** Submissions to a particular conference via OSF for Meetings are aggregated on one page that is visible to visitors.

Users can submit their talks/presentations to the conference on the conference page. All submissions are listed and linked to their respective OSF projects. Download counts for each submitted file are provided.

The title of the conference is displayed in large font at the top of the page. Below the title are two links::
  
  Add your poster or talk | Conference homepage
  
Clicking **Add your poster or talk** causes a drop-down section to unfold that explains to visitors how to submit to the conference::
  
  Add your poster or talk
  Send an email to the following address(es) from the email account you would like used on the OSF:

  For posters, email [endpoint]-poster@osf.io
  For talks, email [endpoint]-talk@osf.io
  The format of the email should be as follows:

    **Subject**
    Presentation title
    **Message body**
    Presentation abstract (if any)
    **Attachment**
    Your presentation file (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF, etc.)
  
  Once sent, we will follow-up by sending you the permanent identifier that others can use to cite your work; you can also login and make changes, such as uploading additional files, to your project at that URL. If you didn't have an OSF account, one will be created automatically and a link to set your password will be emailed to you; if you do, we will simply create a new project in your account. By creating an account you agree to our Terms [links to: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.md] and that you have read our Privacy Policy [links to: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md], including our information on Cookie Use [links to:https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md].

Clicking the **Conference homepage** link takes the user to the external conference webpage/site.

Below these two links is the list of conference submissions. The submissions are divided into the following columns::
  
    Title | Author | Category | Date Created | Downloads

The user can click the up or down arrows to the right of each column header to sort the submissions. Clicking the up arrow in the "Title" and "Author" columns sorts submissions alphabetically, and clicking the down arrow sorts them in reverse alphabetical order. Clicking the up arrow in the "Category" column sorts submissions by all posters appearing first in the list, and clicking the down arrow sorts by all talks appearing first in the list. Clicking the up arrow in the "Date Created" column sorts submissions by oldest to the most recent date submitted, and clicking the down arrow sorts by the most recent date to the oldest date submitted. Clicking the up arrow in the "Downloads" column sorts submissions by least number of downloads to the most, and clicking the down arrow sorts by the most number of downloads to the least.
  
Submitting to a conference
--------------------------

**Purpose**: Users can email their poster/talk to the email address on the conference site and an OSF project will be created automatically.

The OSF generates two email addresses for conferences - one for posters and one for talks - to which users can email their submissions. When the user emails their poster/talk to the corresponding email address, they receive the following email from the OSF::
  
  Hello Rebecca Rosenblatt,

  Congratulations! You have successfully added your [conference name] talk to the Open Science Framework (OSF).

  You now have a permanent, citable URL, that you can share: [url/guid]. All submissions for [conference name] may be viewed at the following link: [meeting site url].

  Get more from the OSF by enhancing your project with the following:

  Collaborators/contributors to the submission

  Charts, graphs, and data that didn't make it onto the submission

  Links to related publications or reference lists

  Connecting other accounts, like Dropbox, Google Drive, GitHub, figshare and Mendeley via add-on integration. Learn more and read the full list of available add-ons: http://help.osf.io/m/addons

  Sincerely yours,

  The OSF Robot

An OSF project is created automatically for the user with the file for their poster/talk that they attached in the email submission. The project is tagged with the conference's endpoint as well as "talk" or "poster," depending on the type of presentation.

**Use cases**

If the user does not attach a file to their email, they receive an email saying::
  
  Hello [username],

  You recently tried to create a project on the Open Science Framework via email, but your message did not contain any file attachments. Please try again, making sure to attach the files you'd like to upload to your message.

  Sincerely yours,

  The OSF Robot
  
If the user does not add a subject tite or email body, no OSF project will be created and the user will not receive an email that notifies them of this.

If a user creates an OSF project and deletes it, and then submits a poster/talk with the name of the deleted project in the email subject line, a new project will be created, regardless of having a deleted project with the same name.
