**Purpose:** A user's notification settings allow them to manage their email preferences regarding newsletters and comments.

To configure the their notifications, the user must first click the gear in the right hand side of the :ref:`navigation bar<navigation-bar>`
and then click on "Notifications" in the left hand menu bar.

Two sections are available on this page: Configure Email Preferences and Configure Notification Preferences.

Email Preferences
-----------------

**Purpose:** A user's email preferences enable them to identify what kind of newsletters they are most interested in receiving.

To subscribe or unsubscribe from an email newsletter, the user can select or unselect the checkbox next to the the relevant topic.

At present, only one option is listed: "Open Science Framework General." Below this option is muted text that reads::

    Receive general notifications about the OSF every 2-3 weeks.

If the user checks the box and clicks the "Save" button below the option, then they will subscribe themselves to the newsletter. If the user
unchecks the box and saves, they will be unsubscribed and will no longer receive the periodic emails. If the user checks or unchecks the box but does not
save, no changes will be made and on refresh their original setting will still be visible. Clicking "Save" shows green confirmation text
below the button::

    Settings updated.

The text disappears after several seconds.

The "Save" button can be clicked any number of times. The confirmation text will appear each time.

Configure Notification Preferences
----------------------------------

**Purpose:** Configuring notification preferences allows the user to choose how often they would like to receive email updates
about activity related to their OSF projects and comments.

The Configure Notification Preferences panel includes two sections. The first is titled "User Notifications," the second "Project Notifications."
By default, there are no project notifications to configure.

Under "User Notifications" there is a dropdown to manage the frequency of emails regarding "replies to your comments." In the
dropdown next to this category, there are three options: "none," "emails," and "email digest." Selecting "none"—the default choice—will
ensure that the user does not receive any email notifications about replies to their
:ref:`comments <commenting>`. Selecting "emails" will mean that they will receive immediate notification via
email about replies to their comments. Finally, selecting "email digest" will send them an email with a summary of the commenting
activity for that day—if any comments have been left.

Under "Project Notifications" no projects will appear unless the user has visited a :ref:`project's settings <project-settings>`
and configured its notification settings. By default, when no projects are listed, yellow text to the right of the "Project Notifications"
title reads::

    No configured projects.

Project and component titles are links to the project or component overview pages. These links open new tabs.

If the user has configured a project's notification settings to enable email notifications, then that project's tree (i.e. a structured
list of its components) will appear below the "Project Notifications" title. The project tree can be expanded and collapsed, as can
individual components as well as branches of it that contain sub-components.

Below each project or component in the tree is a row that reads::

    Comments Added

To the right of this is a dropdown with the three options: "none," "emails," and "email digest." The user can click to make a change.

Collapsing a component hides the "Comments Added" row, including the dropdown.

Components have the additional dropdown option of "Adopt setting from parent project." This option is default for components. If this option
is selected, then that component will be automatically collapsed so that its dropdown is not visible. It can be expanded.

When a user changes any of the dropdown selections in the "Configure Notification Preferences" panel, the dropdown is replaced by green text
that reads::

    Settings updated

The text disappears and the dropdown reappears after several seconds.
